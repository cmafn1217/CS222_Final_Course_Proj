            <h3><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Chatting</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 90%;">Looking to chat about PC's, games, and more? Well you can join the the subreddit
                r/PcPME to connect with
                others to have those kinds of conversations! It offers topics related towards PC building, whether it
                may be prices or a change in components / combos. Additionally, you may also add some feedback of the
                website to let us know what we can do better to help many more beginners. Questions from others and
                yourself will be answered by our knowledgable staff, armed with the ability to help you get a deeper
                understanding of what you need to know without making it too complicated.</p>
            <h3><i class="far fa-handshake"></i> Consultation</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 90%;">
                For a more serious kind of chatting, you are given the opportunity to book
                one-on-one meetings with staff
                to guide and/or help you with your journey in PC building. Booking is made easy just by filling out a
                google form, and giving it around 1-2 business days to get a reply and desired meeting date. Linked
                below is the google form to request for one-on-one meetings.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-hammer"></i> Building</h3>
            <p style="max-width: 90%;">
                If you're feeling scared to handle the somewhat fragile PC components, or frightened to pick out the
                wrong parts, then fear no longer as our team is willing to do all that for you. All we ask is that you
                provide a budget, provide what you wish to do with the PC, and any other requests you may have in the
                google form provided below. Payment for the build will be processed after we give you a list of the
                parts and see if they meet expectations. This is also a way to give you the right components to
                purchase, but build it yourself.
                <br><br>
                Give us your needs and desires here to get started on your PC-building journey! <i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
